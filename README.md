# Flight Fare Prediction

This Machine Learning project aims to predict Flight Fares based on various input features such as airline, date of journey, number of stops, and more. The project utilizes regression models and feature engineering techniques to accurately estimate flight prices, providing valuable insights for travel planning and budgeting.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering for extracting relevant information from date and time
- Implementation of regression models such as Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, etc.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, etc.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
